## Materials and Equipment
- A loaf of your favorite bread (I like sourdough)
- Raspberry jam
- Peanutbutter
- A butter knife
- A pretty plate
- A toaster (optional)

### Protocol Steps
1. Select 2 of the best looking slices of bread and stick them in the toaster until they are a nice golden brown (this is optional, untaosted bread works just as well!)
2. Open the jar of jam and using the butter knife spead a thick layer on one of the pieces of bread
3. Open the jar of peanut butter and spread a layer onto the other piece of the bread
4. Sandwich the two pieces of bread together so that the spreads remain in the middle
5. Slice in half along the diagonal, serve on your plate of choice, and enjoy!
